# **Zero 2 Hero Machine Learning**

This repository contains the information and implementations of the machine learning models:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning

## **Supervised Learning Models:**
1. ***Linear Regression:*** Predicts a continuous outcome based on input features.
2. ***Logistic Regression:*** Used for binary classification problems.
3. ***Decision Trees:*** Non-linear model that makes decisions based on features.
4. ***Random Forest:*** Ensemble method using multiple decision trees.
5. ***Support Vector Machines (SVM):*** Classifies data by finding a hyperplane in a high-dimensional space.
6. ***K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):*** Classifies data based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.
7. ***Naive Bayes:*** Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.

## **Unsupervised Learning Models:**
1. ***K-Means Clustering:*** Divides data into k clusters based on similarity.
2. ***Hierarchical Clustering:*** Creates a tree of clusters, useful for hierarchical relationships.
3. ***DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):*** Clusters dense regions of data points.
4. ***Principal Component Analysis (PCA):*** Reduces dimensionality of data by transforming it into principal components.
5. ***Independent Component Analysis (ICA):*** Separates a multivariate signal into additive, independent components.
6. ***Hidden Markov Models (HMM):*** Models sequences and can be used for time series analysis.
